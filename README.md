# synthetic multiple language generator on natural image
This repository is for synthesizing multiple script language on natural images. And it is the dataset generation code for paper (A Study of Script Language Effects In Deep Neural-Network-Based Scene Text Detection). A lot of work is based on [https://github.com/ankush-me/SynthText](https://github.com/ankush-me/SynthText). 

Our improvement to the previous code can be summaried as:
  * Make it works for different languages
  * Make it can generate different language on same image with similary visual effect. ( i.e. same background image, inpainted texts have same location, color, distortion, opacity. The only difference is language )
