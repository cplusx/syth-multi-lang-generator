# synthetic multiple language generator on natural image
This repository is for synthetic multiple language generator on natural images

This work in based on this work https://github.com/ankush-me/SynthText. 

We modified their code, making it:
    * work for different languages
    * can generate same sample with different language. ( i.e. same background image, inpainted texts have same location, color, distortion, opacity. The only difference is language )
